# mocha + markdown = mockdown

> Note: as of the 0.0.x releases, this package doesn't actually *parse* markdown or handle directives yet.  You can use the `Example`, `Section`, and `Document` classes, but the parser and the mocha interface aren't quite done yet.  See the [BDD specs](https://github.com/pjeby/mockdown/tree/master/spec.coffee) for how to use the stuff that's implemented so far.

What better place to specify your code's behavior than in its API documentation?  And how better to document your API than with examples?  But if they're not tested, examples tend to get stale and out-of-date.  And testing them by hand is a pain.

But what if you could *automatically* test your examples, as part of your project's existing mocha test suites?  For that matter, what if you could do *documentation-first testing*, by writing the API docs for the API you're creating, and use the examples in them to drive your initial development?

Mockdown lets you do all of these things, and more, by testing code samples embedded in markdown files, like this:

```javascript
console.log("Hello world!")
```
>     Hello world!

The above is a *documentation test*, or "doctest".  You embed a code block to be run, optionally followed by a blockquoted code block representing its output.  (If you don't include the output block, it's the same as asserting the example outputs nothing.)

If the output doesn't match, or an unexpected error is thrown, the test fails.  If your test completes asynchronously, you can use `wait()` to defer the test's completion until a callback, promise resolution, or other asynchronous result occurs:

```javascript
var done = wait();  // this gets a callback... but we could have also just
                    // passed in a promise, predicate, or timeout to wait for

setTimeout(function(){
  console.log("Hello world!");
  done();
}, 50);
```
>     Hello world!

Section headings in your markdown files define mocha suites, so your test suites will precisely match the table of contents of your documentation files.  If you need to do things like mark tests to be skipped or ignored, you can add simple HTML comment directives like this:

<!-- mockdown: ++ignore -->
    <!-- mockdown: ++skip -->

in order to mark a test pending, override the language defaults, change how output is checked, etc.

And since these directives are HTML comments, they don't show up when viewing the docs on github, or in any HTML docs you're generating for your website.  (Which means your readers won't get distracted by stuff that only matters to your testing process.)

Mockdown was inspired and influenced both by Python's [`doctest`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html#simple-usage-checking-examples-in-a-text-file) module and Ian Bicking's [DoctestJS](http://doctestjs.org/), but is a new implementation specifically created to work with mocha and markdown.  Unlike DoctestJS, it:

* Works with markdown on the server instead of HTML in the browser
* Uses standard Node console inspection utilities instead of rolling its own pretty-print facilities, and
* Supports other languages besides plain Javascript -- including the use of multiple languages in the same document
* Uses mocha for test running and reporting, allowing integration into existing test suites

## Usage

To include documentation files in your test suites, just pass a list of filenames and an options object to `mockdown.testFiles()`:

```js
var mockdown = require('mockdown');

mockdown.testFiles(['README.md'], {
  languages: ['javascript'],  
  suite: describe,
  test: it
})
```

If you call this from a top-level module, the added test suites will be at the top level;  if you call it from inside a suite or `describe()` block, the suites will be nested within that block.
